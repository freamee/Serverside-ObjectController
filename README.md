## About

Serverside **'static'** object creator for FiveM.
<br>
You can easily create objects on serverstart with synced variables and other helping functions.

Keep in mind these objects are **not networked** on clientside, so if you are triggering a clientside function on them it will not be synced to other clients.

## Features

- Add variables to objects (shared or only server variable)
- Click on objects with raycasting. (turnoff available in config.lua)
- Config and **'globally'** triggered events already added. (Object clicking, variable change, etc.) [CHECK CONFIG](config.lua)
